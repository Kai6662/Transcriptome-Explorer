# Transcriptome-Explorer
A comprehensive RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline

This project encompasses a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing RNA-Seq data, focusing on the identification of differentially expressed genes using DESeq2 and Limma and subsequent functional enrichment analysis. The script takes raw count data as input, normalizes it, and applies rigorous statistical methods to detect differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, it leverages various R packages to conduct functional enrichment, aiming to unravel the biological implications of the differential expression. The script also includes visualization tools to produce clear, interpretable plots of the data and results.
