# Transcriptome-Explorer
A comprehensive RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline

This project encompasses a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing RNA-Seq data, focusing on the identification of differentially expressed genes using DESeq2 and Limma and subsequent functional enrichment analysis. The script takes raw count data as input, normalizes it, and applies rigorous statistical methods to detect differentially expressed genes. Subsequently, it leverages various R packages to conduct functional enrichment, aiming to unravel the biological implications of the differential expression. The script also includes visualization tools to produce clear, interpretable plots of the data and results.

Installation Guide
Prerequisites
This script requires R (version 3.6 or later) and several R packages. Make sure you have R installed on your system. If you do not, you can download it from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

Cloning the Repository
To get the script on your local machine, clone the repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command (replace "your-repository-url" with the URL of your GitHub repository):

bash
Copy code
git clone your-repository-url
This will create a copy of the repository in your local machine.

Installing R Packages
The script requires several R packages. Here's how to install them:

Open R or RStudio, and run the following commands:

R
Copy code
packages <- c("DESeq2", "pheatmap", "tidyverse", "cowplot", "Matrix.utils", "edgeR", "dplyr", "magrittr", 
"Matrix", "purrr", "reshape2", "S4Vectors", "tibble", "apeglm", "png", "RColorBrewer", "optparse", "limma", 
"edgeR", "openxlsx", "ggplot2", "ggrepel", "clusterProfiler", "enrichplot", "gprofiler2", "ggplot2", "enrichR", 
"tidyverse", "STRINGdb", "igraph")

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))
The script will automatically install any package in the list that is not already installed.

Running the Script
To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the script file (EDKO.DESEQ2.R) in R or RStudio, then source the script:

R
Copy code
source("EDKO.DESEQ2.R")
Follow the instructions in the script to input your data and run the analysis.

Getting Help
If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please check the GitHub Issues page for this repository. If you don't see your issue, feel free to open a new one.

Make sure to replace "your-repository-url" with the actual URL of your repository.

I hope this guide helps users install and run your script. Let me know if you want any changes or additions.
